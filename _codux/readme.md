## issues

- alias doesn't work for the img. only relative path works
- css nested classes aren't recognized in panel
- style panel seems not to recognize css vars the point to other css vars
- can't seem to be able to select the hover selector (css modules)
- and the states don't seem to work..
- in a few cases adding a class requires reload (not sure of what) to show in the panel
